# file_encryption_decryption

## Description 

This project is a Python-based file encryption and decryption tool using the cryptography library's Fernet module. It securely encrypts and decrypts files using symmetric key cryptography, ensuring data confidentiality.

### Key Features:

Generates a secure encryption key.
Encrypts and decrypts files using the Fernet cipher.
Reads and writes encrypted data securely.
Provides a command-line interface for user input.

### Skills Demonstrated:

Cryptography and data security.
File handling in Python (open() with rb and wb modes).
Implementing symmetric key encryption.
Basic error handling and user input validation.

### Tools & Technologies Used:

Python
cryptography library (Fernet)
File I/O operations
